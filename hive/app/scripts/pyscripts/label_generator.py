    The yield statement suspends functionâ€™s execution and sends a value back to caller, but retains enough state to
    enable function to resume where it is left off. When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after
    the last yield run. This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather them computing them at
    once and sending them back like a list.
